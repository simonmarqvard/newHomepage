  <h1> TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN </h1>
  <p>While modern life is full of job, family, academic and interpersonal
    responsibilities, “Take the Money and Run” is a game that allows anyone to
    live out their dreams of dropping our of the rat-race and traveling the world
     (in a safe and much less expensive
    way). Inspired in equal parts by Oregon Trail, Tamagotchi, and the oppressive
     noise of the New York City Subway, this game attempts to do very little in a
      fun way. This was a collaboration with Simon Marqvard. Technologies used:
      Mappa is a Javascript
    framework which wraps the functionality of several different mapping APIs
    together. It was used to generate maps and the coordinate positions for map
    overlays. The underlying map provider we used was the open-source Leaflet.js.
     P5.js provided most
    of the visual UX/UI elements of the project, including generating short
     humorous ‘postcards’ for the players with data pulled from various sources,
      including Flickr’s API, Node.js in conjunction with socket.io controlled
      our back-end elements, including
    our interface with our Firebase database, which housed player data and
    allowed the program to run from Heroku.</p>
