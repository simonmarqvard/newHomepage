<h2>Alive</h2>
<h3>Real time biological feedback</h3>

<p>
  A project created in collaboration with patternmaker and creative technologist
  <a href="https://sandyhsieh.com/info">Sandy Hsieh</a>. The project aims to
  explore real time biological measures trasmitted wirelessly to a computer.
  Respiration and pulse sensors were built into a wearable device to provide
  instant feedback to the user wearing it. These biological measurements were
  selected on their precision as well as a high degree of self-control making
  the feedback interactive for the user.

    The project consisted of three pieces: 1. Chest strap with built in
    stretch-conductive-fabric. Measuring the expansion of the lungs. 2. Case
    containing a microcontroller connected to power and a bluetooth transmitter
    - emitting data from the fabric to a computer. 3. Shirt with built in
    stretch-conductive-fabric and a pocket to contain the transmitting case. The
    information folder - describing the individual parts in our project can be
    seen by clicking the image.

  With this project we wanted to visualize and manipulate respiration. A
  computer program provides a patterns for people to follow by inhaling and
  exhaling. Respiration was then visualized by a line going up when people
  inhaled and down when people exhaled. The visuals would adjust according to
  peoples maximum and minimum values - providing a similar visual output for the
  user regardless of age, size and physical shape. Three different breathing
  patterns were implemented. After the breathing exercises the user would
  receive a history of what their repiration looked like.

    A user is following the breathpattern. The breath of the user is shown with
    a line. The pattern to follow is made of circles.

  The case was 3d printed from a sketch found on
  <a
    href="https://learn.adafruit.com/3d-printed-case-for-adafruit-feather/parts"
    >adafruit</a
  >
  specifically made to fit the adafruit feather and a small battery. The entire
  circuit was put together on the featherboard to limit the size as much as
  possible.
