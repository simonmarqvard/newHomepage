      The layout from my glucose project. Each day is represented vertically.
      For each day there are four measurements represented by charts. The charts
      show your values (green) and compare them to the recommended guidelines
      (red).

  <p>
    A data visualization project displaying blood glucose values and comparing
    them to recommended guidelines. Using the button in the corner of the
    display you can add your daily measurements and timepoints to the 'calendar'
    that will dynamically expand to fit the added measurements. Pressing submit
    stores the data in a Database (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a
    >) attached to the <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> app
    rendering and deploying the program. The charts are doughnut multi charts
    from <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">chart.js. </a> And everything is
    stitched together using javaScript.

  <p>
    The idea for the project originated in a class where we had to collect data
    about ourselves and create a meaningful visualization for it. From curiosity
    I chose to collect blood droplets every day using a blood glucose kit bought
    on the internet. The purpose was to investigate my blood sugar levels during
    a stressful week where sleep, exercise and healthy food is often neglected.
    I collected my measurements four times every day for a week: Morning, before
    lunch, after lunch and before going to bed.
