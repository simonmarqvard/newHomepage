   <span> The layout from my glucose project. Each day is represented vertically. For
   each day there are four measurements represented by charts. The charts show your values (green) and
    compare them to the recommended guidelines (red). </span>
    </div>

  <p> A data visualization project displaying blood glucose values
     and comparing them to recommended guidelines. Using the button in the
     corner of the display you can add your daily measurements and timepoints
     to the 'calendar' that will dynamically expand to fit the added measurements.
     Pressing submit stores the data in a Database (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>)
     attached to the <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> app rendering
     and deploying the program. The charts are doughnut multi charts
     from <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">chart.js. </a> And everything
     is stitched together using javaScript.
   </p>

  <p>
    The idea for the project originated in a class where we had to collect data about ourselves
    and create a meaningful visualization for it. From curiosity I chose to collect blood droplets every
    day using a blood glucose kit bought on the internet. The purpose was to investigate my
    blood sugar levels during a stressful week where sleep, exercise and healthy food is often
    neglected. I collected my measurements four
    times every day for a week: Morning, before lunch, after lunch and before going to bed.

      (Note: the sketch was built for a bigger display. To get an optimal view, zoom out)
