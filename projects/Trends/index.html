This project was created for the <em>"API - mashups" </em> class at ITP. The assignment was to create a single
page web experience that uses data from a public API and incorporates the use of at least one
Javascript "interaction" library.

<br>
<br>

For this project I used the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-trends-api">google trends API</a>. This API allows you to see the google searches that are trending
in different countries. The API has been collecting data since 2004 giving you the option to choose a
startDate and endDate if you are interested in a certain time period. Also, another function provides
global information displaying the countries in which your searchword was more popular. <br><br>

<div class="imagesetup">
<img src="/projects/Trends/TrendsOlym.png"
     alt="circles">
     <span> Searching the word: "Olympics" in Brazil returns a trend in August 2016, which is when the olympics were held </span>
</div>


The google trends library is only available through <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> - so for this project to work I had to set up
a server. I did that using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digitalocean</a>, creating a cloud server (droplet) from which I could serve my content.
I used <a href="https://fetchsoftworks.com/fetch/">Fetch </a> for file transfer to the server.
<br>
<br>

The Globe was created using D3.js based on an <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoPath">example </a>from Mike Bostock. The data is visualized using
<a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a> and user interaction inputs/buttons were made using jQuery.
