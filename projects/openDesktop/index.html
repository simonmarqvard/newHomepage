<h2>Open Desktop</h2>
<p>Experiment from my ITP thesis project called Safety Last.</p>

<p>
  "I have always imagined the perfect sharing tool as one where you can drag
  files directly from one desktop to another. This application was inspired by
  that idea."
</p>

<p>
  Open Dekstop is an application that reimagines file sharing by using your desktop as a
  communal environment. Clients can see files located on others clients devices
  and freely move them - to take, give or distribute files among users. With
  this application there is no upload or download - simply the movement of
  files.

    Example with three online users. The application tracks the content on your desktop and
    reveals it to other users. By dragging and dropping you can take
    files from other users, send files to other users or distribute files
    between other users.
  </span>
</div>

<p>
  The application is part of an exploration, investigating the question: "Would
  more creative applications in software be unleashed if we didn't start by
  saddling designers and developers with privacy and security concerns?" I
  wanted to explore what we could do with software if instead of always thinking
  safety first, we put interaction first and safety last. The intention was to
  break from the restrictions and limitations that comes with safe and private
  applications.

    The Open Desktop application was featured in my ITP Thesis project called
    "Safety Last". Watch the live stream from my final presentation to hear more about
    my thoughts and intentions behind the project.

<p> The project combines frontend and backend programming. The application is
  built using Electron.js to access native system components and serve them
  in a browser window. Socket.io and socket-stream are used to exchange user information
  and transfer content between users. The following shows the frontend
  design iterations and backend system architecture.
