  <p> Inspired by danish modern artist: Carl Henning Pedersen I wanted to transfer a oil
  painting into mosaic. In order to know where to place the glass tiles on the piece I wrote two
  java algorithms using processing. <p>
    <ol>
    <li> One algorithm would isolate specific colors and get the contour of them. </li>
    <li> The second algorithm would turn the original image into tiles and assign
    a color to the tile based on the pixel value from the original image. </li>
      </ol>
    <div class="imagesetup">
      <img src="/projects/mosaic/double.png" alt ="image" height="50">
      <span> Color isolation and contour is seen on the image to the left, while the image on the
        right shows the original piece turned into tiles with a letter in each tile representing the color.
       </span>
       </div>
     <p> The contour of certain colors were imported to vectorworks where tiles would be added to follow the contour
       path. The intention was to break with the grid structure of the image and locate tiles with respect to their original position.
       Also, Vectorworks was used to resize tiles, margins etc. to fit my mosaic glass.
       <div class="imagesetup">
         <img src="/projects/mosaic/path.png" alt ="image" height="50">
         <span> The contour of a colorshape and the finalized grid. The grid would provide guidelines about where to position tiles and
           which colors to choose.
          </span>
          </div>
      <p> From here it was manual labor attaching the glass. The following shows a few images of the finished piece:
