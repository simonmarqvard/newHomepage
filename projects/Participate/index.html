<h2>Participate</h2>

<h3>Remote computer control application</h3>

<p>
  "A project inspired by Google docs - an online platform where people
  collaborate in text documents. This application differs, however, by making
  your computer the collaborate platform."
</p>

<p>
  Participate is a custom built application intended to simplify collaboration.
  It works as a remote computer control application - allowing a user to take
  control of another persons screen, keyboard and mouse in real-time from a
  public webpage.
</p>

<p>
  The project is joined by two systems: A Desktop application and a webpage. The
  webpage is the central command from which you can take control of other
  computers. The computers you want to remote control must have the application
  installed and running.

    The webpage has two states. One is displaying computers running the
    application (left). When selecting a user you access the screen of that
    computer (right). Maximizing the screen will give you control of mouse and
    keyboard.</span

    This video shows how the application works. The computer in the middle is
    visiting a public webpage, while the computer to the right and the left are
    running the application.

  The application is built using webRTC, peer.js, Electron.js, Robot.js and
  includes a webserver and peerserver. The following image shows how the entire
  system is structured.

<p>
  The application is part of an exploration, investigating the question: "Would
  more creative applications in software be unleashed if we didn't start by
  saddling designers and developers with privacy and security concerns?" I
  wanted to explore what we could do with software if instead of always thinking
  safety first, we put interaction first and safety last. The intention was to
  break from the restrictions and limitations that comes with safe and private
  applications.

    The Participate application was featured in my ITP Thesis project called
    "Safety Last". Watch the live stream from my final presentation to hear more
    about my thoughts and intentions behind the project.
