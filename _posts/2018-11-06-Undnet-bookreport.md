Networks of New York - "An Illustrated Field Guide To Urban Internet Structure" by Ingrid Burrington. I was assigned this book to do a book report in the Understanding Networks class.

Notes on the book can be downloaded from this
<a href="/blog_assets/2018-11-06/NotesNetworksNYC.rtf">link</a> (.txt file)
And slides from the presentation can be seen on this <a href="/blog_assets/2018-11-06/prÃ¦s.pdf">link</a>

The book is introducing the reader to the physical layer of the internet and how to spot it in the city. It wants to answer the question "What does the internet look like?" - and move away from the assumption of the internet being a "cloud" - emphasizing that it is physical.

The book is divided into three chapters explaining what to look for in the city and how things are connected:
<br>Below the ground
<br>Ground level
<br>Above ground
