Make a device to control playback of synthesized or pre-recorded music using MIDI. Your device will send MIDI messages to another device which will play the music.

For this assignment I first had to understand how MIDI works. I used some resources provided in class to get familiar with MIDI messsages and hexadecimal numbers to better understand the organization of the MIDI protocol (resources: [1](https://tigoe.github.io/SoundExamples/midi.html), [2](https://tigoe.github.io/SoundExamples/midi.html), [3](https://tigoe.github.io/SoundExamples/midi.html)).

I decided to go with something xylophone inspired. I wanted to have 6 bars - each triggering a message that would be interpreted and played in [Sforzando](https://www.plogue.com/products/sforzando.html).

Each bar would have a piezo (vibration-sensor) connected to it as the trigger. Aside from just playing a tone - I wanted to make a sustain button. When pressing this button and hitting a note - the note would continuously play allowing you to play notes on top of the sustained one.

I attached the piezo to one of my bars and tested how reliable it was. It worked pretty well. However, as the video demonstrates there was a problem with my code. I was using a delay-function to decide the length of the node. Because of this delay I would not be able to hit two notes simultaneously or back to back. Instead, I created a timer that would set the tone length.

When I had the timer working I needed to make sure that hitting a bar would only trigger a node once. For that to work I was using a [debounce](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Debounce).

At this point I had my bars working - and attached an on/off switch and a light to indicate whether the instrument was on/off and a light to indicate when a bar was triggered.

I never made it to the point where I could have a sustained tone play in the background when holding down a button. My impression - when talking to other people in this class and people who use MIDI extensively - is that I spent too much time on the Arduino side of things. Instead of using Arduino code to determine the length of a node I should use the computer software to control it instead. Or I could have put a potentiometer into my controller to control the length of the node through the music software.

It seems I should have taken advantage of the software to a greater extent than I did. Using the Arduino to message noteOn/noteOff and the software to create a sustained tone, determine length of tone etc. These are valuable lessons for my next MIDI project.

This is what my project eventually looked like:
