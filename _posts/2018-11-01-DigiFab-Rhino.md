This week for Designing for Digital Fabrication I am presenting on the RhinocerosÂ® CAD (Computer Aided Drawing) software - Also referred to as Rhino. It is developed by Robert McNeel and Associates.

Information about the Rhino Software:
Used in architecture, industrial design, product design for manufacturing, prototyping, 3D printing and reverse engineering.

It has many features similar to VectorWorks and my impression is that the are competing for the same audience. Even in this class.

A number of features Rhino and VW have in common (That we have been using a lot in class).
  * General program layout
  * Tool selection palette
  * Navigating the object window
  * Snapping tools  
  * Layer options

There are some differences between the programs. In my experience especially when it comes to 3D. It seems that Rhino was built specifically for 3d modelling (it is also referred to as Rhino3D). I'm not sure if VectorWorks was intended for that in early days or picked it up later?

Useful Rhino features:
  * Commandline! - [Commandlist](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/5/help/en-us/commandlist/command_list.htm)
  * You can use scripts to draw [Python](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/rhinopython/what-is-rhinopython/)
  * Popular plugins (Grasshopper -> kangaroo)
