  <h1> ALIVE </h1>
  <p> The "Alive" project was created in collaboration with <a href="https://sandyhsieh.com/info">Sandy Hsieh</a>. The project aimed
       to explore which biological measures we could wirelessly transmit to a computer from a functional wearable.
       ECG, EMG, pulse and respiration were all tested for this project, with pulse and respiration being
       our final endpoints due to the precision of the measurements as well as
       a higher degree of self-control making these measures interesting to interact with.
       The project consisted of three pieces.

       <ul>
       <li> A chest strap with built in stretch-conductive-fabric. Measuring the expansion of the lungs. Making it easy for
       users to interact with the project. </li>
       <li> A 3d printed case containing a microcontroller connected to a battery and a bluetooth
       transmitter sending data from the fabric to a computer. </li>
       <li> A shirt with built in stretch-conductive-fabric and a pocket to contain the transmitting case.</li>
     </ul>
  </p>

      <p>
       With this project we wanted to visualize the respiration of the users and have people breathe
       in a certain way by following a pattern displayed in front of them. Respiration was visualized
       as a line going up when people inhaled and going down when people exhaled. The x and y scale would adjust
       according to peoples max and min values providing a similar visual output for the user regardless of age, size and
       physical shape.
       Three different breathingpatterns were implemented to make the user breathe in certain ways. After the three exercises
       the user would receive a history of what their repiration looked like.

    <p> The case was 3d printed from a sketch found on <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/3d-printed-case-for-adafruit-feather/parts">adafruit</a>
      specifically made to fit the adafruit feather and a small battery. The entire circuit was put together on
      the featherboard to limit the size as much as possible.
