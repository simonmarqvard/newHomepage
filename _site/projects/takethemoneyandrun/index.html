  <h1> TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN </h1>
  <p>While modern life is full of job, family, academic and interpersonal
    responsibilities, <em>“Take the Money and Run”</em> is a game that allows anyone to
    live out their dreams of dropping out of the rat-race and traveling the world
     (in a safe and much less expensive
    way). Inspired in equal parts by Oregon Trail, Tamagotchi, and the oppressive
     noise of the New York City Subway, this game attempts to do very little in a
      fun way. This was a collaboration with
      <a href="https://www.aidanjnelson.com/">Aidan Nelson</a>. <br><br> Technologies used: <br>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://mappa.js.org/docs/getting-started.html">Mappa</a> is a Javascript framework which wraps the functionality of several different mapping APIs
    together. It was used to generate maps and the coordinate positions for map
    overlays. The underlying map provider we used was the open-source <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet.js</a>. </li>

     <li><a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a> provided most of the visual UX/UI elements of the project, including generating short
     humorous ‘postcards’ for the players with data pulled from various sources,
      including <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr’s API</a>. </li>
      <li>
      Node.js in conjunction with <a href="https://socket.io/">socket.io</a> controlled
      our back-end elements, including
    our interface with our <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase database</a>, which housed player data and
    allowed the program to run from <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. </li>

</ul>
