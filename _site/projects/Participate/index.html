      <main class="projectDetail"><h2>Participate</h2>

<p>Experiment from my ITP thesis project called Safety Last.</p>

<p> "A project inspired by Google docs - an online platform where people collaborate in
  text documents. This application differs, however, by making your computer the
  collaborate platform." </p>

<p> Participate is a custom built application intended to simplify collaboration. It works as a
  remote computer control application - allowing users visiting a webpage
  to take control of another persons screen, keyboard and mouse in real-time. </p>



<div class="imagesetup">
  <img src="/projects/Participate/view.png" alt="image" />
  <span> The webpage has two states. One is displaying computers running the application (left). When selecting
  a user you access the screen of that computer (right). Maximizing the screen will give you control
  of mouse and keyboard.</span>

    This video shows how the application works. The computer in the middle is visiting a public webpage,
     while the computer to the right and the left are running the application.

<p> The application is built using webRTC, peer.js, Electron.js, Robot.js and
  includes a webserver and peerserver. The following image shows how the entire system is structured. </p>

    The Participate application was featured in my ITP Thesis project called
    "Safety Last". Watch the live stream from my final presentation to hear more about
    my thoughts and intentions behind the project.
