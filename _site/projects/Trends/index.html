  <div class="imagesetup">

    <span>
      Use the globe to select a country, then type in a search word to see if it
      has been trending. Or make a global search and the countries will light up
      based on the popularity of the word
    </span>
  </div>

  <p>
  This project was created for the <em>"API - mashups" </em> class at ITP. The
  assignment was to create a single page web experience that uses data from a
  public API and incorporates the use of at least one Javascript "interaction"
  library.
  </p>

  <p>
  For this project I used the
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-trends-api">google trends API</a
  >. This API allows you to see the google searches that are trending in
  different countries. The API has been collecting data since 2004 giving you
  the option to choose a startDate and endDate if you are interested in a
  certain time period. Also, another function provides global information
  displaying the countries in which your searchword was more popular.
  </p>

  <div class="imagesetup">
    <img src="/projects/Trends/TrendsOL.png" alt="circles" />
    <span>
      Searching the word: "Olympics" in Brazil returns a trend in August 2016,
      which is when the olympics were held
    </span>
  </div>

  <p>
  The google trends library is only available through
  <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> - so for this project to work I
  had to set up a server. I did that using
  <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digitalocean</a>, creating a cloud
  server (droplet) from which I could serve my content. I used
  <a href="https://fetchsoftworks.com/fetch/">Fetch </a> for file transfer to
  the server.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Globe was created using D3.js based on an
  <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoPath"
    >example </a
  >from Mike Bostock. The data is visualized using
  <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a> and user interaction
  inputs/buttons were made using jQuery.
