<p>
  "Alive" is a project created in collaboration with
  <a href="https://sandyhsieh.com/info">Sandy Hsieh</a>. The project aims to
  explore which biological measures we could wirelessly transmit to a computer
  from a functional wearable. ECG, EMG, pulse and respiration were all tested
  for this project, with pulse and respiration being our final endpoints. These
  measurements were chosen based on their precision as well as a higher degree
  of self-control making these measures interesting to interact with. The
  project consisted of three pieces.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A chest strap with built in stretch-conductive-fabric. Measuring the
    expansion of the lungs. Making it easy for users to interact with the
    project.
  </li>
  <li>
    A 3d printed case containing a microcontroller connected to a battery and a
    bluetooth transmitter sending data from the fabric to a computer.
  </li>
  <li>
    A shirt with built in stretch-conductive-fabric and a pocket to contain the
    transmitting case.
  </li>
</ul>

  With this project we wanted to visualize the respiration of the users and have
  people breathe in a certain way by following a pattern displayed in front of
  them. Respiration was visualized as a line going up when people inhaled and
  going down when people exhaled. The x and y scale would adjust according to
  peoples max and min values providing a similar visual output for the user
  regardless of age, size and physical shape. Three different breathingpatterns
  were implemented to make the user breathe in certain ways. After the three
  exercises the user would receive a history of what their repiration looked
  like.

    A user is following the breathpattern. The breath of the user is shown with
    a line. The pattern to follow is made of circles.

  The case was 3d printed from a sketch found on
  <a
    href="https://learn.adafruit.com/3d-printed-case-for-adafruit-feather/parts"
    >adafruit</a
  >
  specifically made to fit the adafruit feather and a small battery. The entire
  circuit was put together on the featherboard to limit the size as much as
  possible.
