<h3>
  Turning a painting into a mosaic piece using JavaScript and Computer Aided
  Design software.

<p>
  Inspired by danish modern artist: Carl Henning Pedersen I wanted to transfer a
  oil painting into mosaic. In order to know where to place the glass tiles on
  the piece I wrote two java algorithms using processing.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>One algorithm would isolate specific colors and get the contour of them.</p>
<p>
  The second algorithm would turn the original image into tiles and assign a
  color to the tile based on the pixel value from the original image.
</p>

<div class="imagesetup">
  <img src="/projects/mosaic/double.png" alt="image" />
  <span>
    Color isolation and contour is seen on the image to the left, while the
    image on the right shows the original piece turned into tiles with a letter
    in each tile representing the color.
  </span>
</div>

<p>
  The contour of certain colors were imported to vectorworks where tiles would
  be added to follow the contour path. The intention was to break with the grid
  structure of the image and locate tiles with respect to their original
  position. Also, Vectorworks was used to resize tiles, margins etc. to fit my
  mosaic glass.
</p>

<div class="imagesetup">
  <img src="/projects/mosaic/path.png" alt="image" />
  <span>
    The contour of a colorshape and the finalized grid. The grid would provide
    guidelines about where to position tiles and which colors to choose.
  </span>
</div>
<p>
  From here it was manual labor attaching the glass. The following shows a few
  images of the finished piece:
