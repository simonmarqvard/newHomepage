  <h2> Masters Thesis University of Copenhagen </h2>

  <p> Title: The ageing muscle: Macrophage kinetics and local inflammation in response to resistance training </p>

    <p>
      The research, data collection and analysis was
      performed at <a href="http://ismc.dk/"><em>Institute of Sports Medicine Copenhagen</em> </a>. This work served
      as my graduate thesis and was defended with a public oral <a href="
      http://nexs.ku.dk/specialeforsvar/2016/specialeforsvar-v-simon-marqvard-jensen/">
      <em>presentation</em></a> at University of Copenhagen, September 2016.
      It investigates the age-related changes in human skeletal muscle
      with emphasis on immune- and stem cells.

      The work was performed under guidance of Prof. dr.med. Michael Kjær and Prof.
      Jørgen Wojtaszewski. It was written over the course of 18 months while
      contributing to other projects at the institute. It involved collection
      of tissue samples from test subjects that were stained using immunohistochemistry
      and analyzed using microscopy. The abstract is available when clicking the image below.
