   <span> The layout from my glucose project. Each day is represented vertically. For
   each day there are four measurements represented by charts. The charts show your values and
    compare them to the recommended guidelines </span>
    </div>

  <p>
    This project was based on an assignment where we had to collect data about ourselves
    and find a meaningful way to visualize it. I chose to collect blood droplets every
    day using a blood glucose kit bought on the internet. The purpose was to investigate my
    blood sugar levels during a stressful week where sleep, exercise and healthy food is often
    neglected. I collected my measurements four
    times every day for a week:

    <ul>
    <li>Morning
    <li>Before lunch
    <li>After lunch
    <li>Before going to bed.
    </ul>

    Using the button in the corner of the display you can add your daily measurements and timepoints
    to the 'calendar' that will dynamically expand to fit the added measurements.
    Pressing >>submit<< stores the data in a Database (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>) attached to the
     <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> app rendering and deploying the program. The charts are doughnut multi charts
    from <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">chart.js. </a> And everything is stitched together using javaScript.
     <br>
    The project can be seen <strong><a href="https://datameasuresapiofyou.herokuapp.com/displaydata">here</a></strong>
    (Note: the sketch was built for a bigger display. To get an optimal view, zoom out)
    <br>
    More information about how the projects was created can be found in my first blogpost <a href="/2018/04/18/API-of-you.html">here</a> and my
