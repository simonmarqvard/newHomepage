        <p>I decided to keep working on my midterm project: visualizing
and comparing daily blood glucose measurements to recommended guidelines. One of the things I wanted to add to the existing project was a database and provide forms for users to input and update data in a simple way.</p>

        <p>This week we had our Final in “Mashup - creating with web API’s”. For this project I
went back to my initial idea of creating a single page website that would display data
for individual countries. This was the idea I presented in the very first weeks of this class. Originally I wanted to do it with Twitter trends API - but decided
to do it with the Google Trends API instead.</p>

        <p>For the midterm in “API of you” we had to collect a dataset based on ourselves. From
the data we had to create a .json file that would display our collected information
in an interesting way.</p>

assignment was to get familiar with one of them and create a sketch using data from a different source.</p>

        <p>The past weeks we have been working on a video for a final presentation. The assignment was to create a short documentary, infomercial, commercial or portrait. We were assigned into groups that we would be working with for the next 3 weeks. Our assignment for the first week was to come up with an idea and create a storyboard. The second week we had to shoot our footage and create a rough cut and the final week we had to do the final edit and present our piece.</p>

        <p>This week in class we were introduced to objects and arrays. Objects it turns out, has changed slightly – so that it is now a class and a constructor you use to create an object. After becoming more familiar with this it now makes perfect sense. I spent a lot of time on this weeks quiz. I found it very difficult. Especially the challenge and the SuperDuperChallenge – with some help i managed to sort it out.</p>
