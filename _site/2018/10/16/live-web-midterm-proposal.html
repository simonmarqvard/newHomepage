        <p>For the midterm assignment I would like to create my own chat/videochat-app. I use video communication
every day talking to friends and family in other parts of the world. Instead of going through Fb-messenger, Google or Skype I would like to connect with people through a service I created myself.</p>

<p>My idea is to combine sockets.io, WebRTC and PeerJS to create a videochat app. On the page you can see who is online and available to chat - you can call the person you want to talk to and you can make a group conversion with several people simultaneously. If possible, I would also like to make a screen-share feature so that I could potentially share my screen with others who are on the call. I have been told that <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-capture/">“webRTC screen share”</a> could be a place to look for this. Also <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/getscreenmedia">this npm</a> seems to useful for this feature.</p>

<p>From a layout perspective I was thinking about arranging peoples’ videos in a way similar to this Skype example. <br />
  Also, if the video can be treated as HTML a video player - features such as fullscreen/volume could be added for extra controls.</p>

</div>

<p>An ‘online indicator’ could be added next to the callID for each person on the page. Similar to the one we know from several other platforms.</p>

<p><br />
As we have already used some of these libraries and features in class - my hope is that this idea will be executable in a week. If not, I will focus on the Video-call and Screen-share aspect of the assignment.</p>
