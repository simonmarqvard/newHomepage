        <p>For this project I would like to convert a painting into a mosaic piece. Using a “tile” sketch and a “color/contour” sketch made in processing my idea is to import it into Vectorworks and laser-etch tile instructions to a surface - to which I will add glass mosaic.</p>

<p>This project is inspired by Carl Henning Pedersen, a danish modern artist, who did a lot of mosaic pieces in Denmark in the 80’s.</p>

<div class="aroundImage">

</div>

<p>My idea is to take an already existing painting and turn it into a grid/tiles using processing. Each tile in the grid will use a letter for the color. Ex. r = red, g = green, b=blue, since colors don’t get transferred into vectorWorks, the letter will indicate the color of the specific tile.</p>

<div class="aroundImage">
<img src="/blog_assets/2018-10-04/tileImage.png" alt="circles" />
</div>

<p>Printing this into a surface would indicate where to place the tiles and also which color to use.
To avoid a monotonous expression of all tiles being placed in the similar grid-like structure, my idea was to select certain colors from an image, red, blue or green and get the contour of the color. It could look something like the following.</p>

<div class="aroundImage">
<img src="/blog_assets/2018-10-04/red.png" alt="circles" />
</div>

<div class="aroundImage">
<img src="/blog_assets/2018-10-04/blue.png" alt="circles" />
</div>

<p>In the first image red has been selected and isolated - in the other it is green/blue.
When the colors are selected they can be run through the contour processing sketch that we were provided in-class last week. Here is an example of the “dark” colors before and after going through the contour algorithm.
<br />
<br />
Before:</p>
<div class="aroundImage">
<img src="/blog_assets/2018-10-04/dark.png" alt="circles" />
</div>
<p><br />
After:</p>
<div class="aroundImage">
<img src="/blog_assets/2018-10-04/contourcopy.png" alt="circles" />
</div>

<p>The contour image can then be imported into VectorWorks and cleaned up. The following image is
showing some of the steps.</p>

<div class="aroundImage">
<img src="/blog_assets/2018-10-04/VWsteps.png" alt="circles" />
</div>

<ul>
  <li>the polygon is created using the inner boundary mode attribute in the tools.</li>
  <li>the shape is simplified (using modify -&gt; drafting aids -&gt; simplify polys)</li>
  <li>tiles are added to the path (duplicate along path)</li>
</ul>

<div class="aroundImage">
<img src="/blog_assets/2018-10-04/tilespath.png" alt="circles" />
</div>

<p>Using this method I am planning to chose certain colors and have them “break” the grid-system. Then, hopefully, for the manual work, all I have to do is follow these instructions etched into the surface telling me what angle to place the tiles in and what color to use.
Here’s a few examples of the glass/ceramic tiles I’m considering for the image:</p>

<div class="aroundImage">

</div>

<p>The process is almost like a digital litograph. Selecting a color individually, getting the contour of its shape and then adding its “instructions” to the image.</p>
