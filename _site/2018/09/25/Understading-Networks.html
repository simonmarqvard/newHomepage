        <p>This week in Understanding Networks our assignment was to explore the TraceRoute commando.
TraceRoute is a computer network diagnostic tool displaying paths and measuring transit delays
of packets across an IP network.</p>

<p>TraceRoute can be used from the command line and returns information such as: Hop number, Round trip time (RTT), Name and IP-address. However the overview you get in the command line can be hard to interpret.</p>

<p>TraceRoute as it looks from the commandLine
<br /></p>

<p>There are many pages out there visualizing the traceRoute information - <a href="https://www.monitis.com/traceroute/">Monitis</a> is one of these.</p>

<p>For this weeks assignment I decided that I wanted to build my own TraceRoute.app - mapping information
from my Domain searches to a map. I wanted to build it in node - since I am still familiarizing myself with this library.</p>

<p>How I imagined it to work:
A npm library called ‘nodejs-traceroute’ would return the Ip-address
from the different “hops”. An API called <a href="http://ip-api.com/docs/api:json">Ip-api</a> would provide additional information such as geolocation and provider for each Ip-address - this would be added to a map. (The information returned from the Ip-API is shown in the following image. <br /></p>

<div class="aroundImage">
<img src="/blog_assets/2018-09-25/IPAPI.png" alt="circles" />
</div>

<p>In my node app, I passed information from each HOP into the API and loaded the returned information into the browser using express. In the browser I used mappa.js, a canvas wrapper for maps, to create a map and imported name, latitude and longitude of each Ip-address into the sketch to get an idea of how paths of IP networks are connected. The app would enable me to type a domain and see the request travel through the world.
I ran into a lot of code-related issues along the way and will need more time to refine functions, provide better information on the map and change the user-input. However, this early version still provides some helpful visual feedback to the topic and is useful as a tool for my own use.</p>

<p>This video shows how the app currently works, displaying a traceRoute request to a government page in Russia.</p>

<p>There was a lot of learning from working on this project in node. Also, when running traceRoute over and over again you tend to see some “network patterns”.</p>

<p>A few observations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A lot of searches to Scandinavia goes through “NORDUnet”. Also, paths going from the US to Scandinavia seem to often go through Madrid first(at least the searches I did).</li>
</ul>

</div>

<ul>
  <li>There are a lot of small jumps in the NewYork city area - often going through New Jersey before moving on to other parts of the US/world.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Denver often seems to be stop between international connections or longer US connections.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that a small number of providers account for the large number of connections.
Tata Communications, Time Warner Cable Internet (Spectrum), Amazon, Level3 and Google* and Facebook* - (* especially when you search google and facebook domains)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
